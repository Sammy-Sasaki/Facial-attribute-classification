# Facial Attribute Classification

Facial attribute classification is the task of predicting attributes or characteristics of a person's face, such as gender, age, or facial expression. This repository provides an implementation of a facial attribute classification system using deep learning techniques.

## Methodology

Our system is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which takes an input image and outputs a set of attribute predictions. The CNN is trained on a large-scale dataset of labeled facial images, and we use transfer learning to fine-tune the pre-trained network for our specific task.

We evaluate the performance of our system on a test set of facial images, and report accuracy and other relevant metrics. We also provide scripts to visualize the predictions of our system on new facial images.

## Usage

To use our facial attribute classification system, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. Then, you can run the provided scripts to train the CNN on your own dataset or to use the pre-trained model to make predictions on new facial images.

## Dataset

We used the CelebA dataset for training and evaluation of our system. The dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity faces, each annotated with 40 attributes such as gender, age, and presence of facial hair.

## Results

Our facial attribute classification system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CelebA dataset, with accuracy rates of over 90% on several attribute categories. We also provide visualizations of the system's predictions on new facial images, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict attributes in a variety of real-world scenarios.
